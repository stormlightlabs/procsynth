In this context, a track is a time-sequenced list of musical events (usually just notes)
that get rendered into MIDI. Each instrument (Piano, Guitar, Drums, etc.) gets its own
track to produce a song.

| Layer                  | Description                                                       | Example                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Track                  | A sequence of timed notes                                         | [NoteEvent, NoteEvent, ...]                        |
| NoteEvent              | A pitch, duration, velocity, and start time                       | Note { pitch: 60, start: 0.0, dur: 0.25, vel: 90 } |
| Motif                  | A repeated rhythmic or melodic shape                              | [0, 2, 4, 5] over [0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0]           |
| Phrase                 | A series of motifs                                                | Often generated procedurally                       |
| Instrument Role        | Bass plays root+fifth, Guitar arpeggiates, Drums hit kicks/snares | Affects pitch range, rhythm style                  |
| Randomization Strategy | Markov, noise, weights                                            | How the next note is picked                        |

### Algorithms

- **Markov Chains** (melody/rhythm generation)
- **Perlin Noise** (texture and flow)
- **Affine Transformations** (move notes/shapes around)
- **L-Systems** (recursive pattern growth)
- **Voronoi + Delaunay** (natural partitions and meshes)
